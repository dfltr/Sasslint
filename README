Currently only checks for duplicate selectors, feel free to patch in other functionality if you like it.

USAGE:

./sasslint somefile.sass

NOTE: SassLint.rb will look for '../sass/lib/sass.rb', which means you should have a local copy of the sass parser checked out. Get it here: https://github.com/nex3/sass
